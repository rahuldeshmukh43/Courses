I did experiments on two different GPUs:
	(1) Tesla V100 on scholar
	(2) RTX A5000 on local machine

The zip file contains Makefile and output for both experiments. The output files also show the device properties.
To run the two experiments, I have macros which need to be uncommented based on which gpu is used in the dotproduct.cpp file
