Time for guided scheduling with default block size: 0.042808

# explanation
In part 1, we found that guided scheduling performed the best. For this part, 
we have quadrupled the number of threads from 4 to 16. The timing improves from
0.142232 to 0.042808, which is a factor of 3.322. This increase is not 4x because
of the overhead in creating parallel threads accross 16 threads.
