Suppose we have an input batch of 16 episodes of image samples, with each episode being of equal length of 50. Based on the design of the rest of the project (which we have already implemented for you), MANNCell should be called 50 times, each time having 16 input samples (along with the offseted labels), and outputting 16 output labels. More specifically, the MANNCell should produce classification labels $[\\hat{y}_0^t, ..., \\hat{y}_{15}^t]$ for all 16 iteration-$t$ image samples batch $[x^t_0+\\text{null}, x^t_1+y_0^t, ..., x^t_{15}+y_{14}^t]$ (\"+\" means concatenation) every time it is called; for your information, it is the class NTMOneShotLearningModel (already implemented below) that actually calls MANNCell 50 times. Your job is to make sure that at a single iteration $t$ (where $t=0,1,2,...,49$), MANNCell correctly parses the input arguments, produce the correct read and write weights $w^r_t, w^w_t$, correctly retrieve from and write to the memory to form $M_t$, and use the right material to get the logits for classification (they will be used for computing the labels and cross-entropy values in NTMOneShotLearningModel), and return the right states that will be used in the next iteration $t+1$. \n","\n","Let us look at the input arguments of the method `call(self, inputs, states)`  of this class first:\n","*   The `inputs` variable shall have the following shape: \n","    `(batch_size, image_size+num_classes)`. \n","  *   It corresponds to the $[x^t_0+\\text{null}, x^t_1+y^t_0, ..., x^t_{15}+y^t_{14}]$ above, for some iteration $t=0,1,...,49$.\n","  *   `inputs[p,:]` is the $p$-th image in the batch `inputs` (note that the images are flattened to 1D tensors, and the labels are one-hot encoded).\n","*   The `states` variable is a dictionary that has the following set of keys:`{'controller_state', 'read_vector_list', 'w_r_list', 'w_u', 'M'}`\n","  *   `controller_state` is the state of the controller in iteration $t-1$; if $t-1 < 0$, then it is just zero-filled.

Comments on implementation and NTM learning algorithm:\n","1. Implementation: I was able to understatnd the ideas discussed in the Handout much clearly while going through the implementation. Also, the choice of having separate varaibles for computing read keys, write keys and interpolation coefficient makes the implementation identical to the equations dicussed in the handout.\n","\n","2. The use of cosine similarity in this case is well suited when compared to other similarity measures. As cosine similarity measure does not place any constraints on the input vectors and always produces a output which is bounded which makes it well suited. On the other hand, the use of other similarity measures such as Earth Movers Distance and Jaccard Similarity are not directly applicable in this case as we would need a normalized vector for the former and a way of converting the real values to countable integers for the latter. Furthermore, cosine similarity comes with a small computation cost when compared to other measures. \n","\n","3. Memory read write process: I beleive reading the memory before writing makes sense intuitively. However, it would be interesting to see if the performance improves if we reverse the process."]}]}
