# Explanation
We run the code with a fixed number 4 threads. We have four sections in
the code which will be ran by these threads.

From the timing log, we can see that the parallel code performs faster
than the sequential code and we get a speed up of 3.988. This is to be expected
as all threads are doing work parallely and specifying tid start and stop ensures
thread safe access.
