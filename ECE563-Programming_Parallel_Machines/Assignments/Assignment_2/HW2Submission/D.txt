Here are the run times for the two programs:

Slow
Elapsed: 174.425164 seconds
----------------
verySlow
Elapsed: 172.643253 seconds

Explanation for why slow.c and verSlow.c differ in runtimes:

The two programs run with different times because of the way how the malloc() allocates the array on DRAM and
how the array is brought to cache when the program is ran. malloc() allocates a contiguous 1D array of locations
for storing the array on DRAM. 

When veryslow.c is ran it brings in a row of matrix A and a column of matrix B, 
since the columns of B are not adjacent to each other the program takes longer to bring in data into cache from DRAM 
for every iteration. As a result, the processor is sitting idle for majority of the time.

Whereas, in case of slow.c the program uses tiling and at a time brings an enitre tilesize squared data into 
the cache and subsequently computes output for that tile. As a result slow.c has to do fewer exchanges between 
DRAM and cache, essentially the processor is being used efficiently here and not sitting idle.
